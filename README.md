# Behavior-Register-to-File

Register behavior exact time and date to text file


Behavior analyst Skinner wrote that to record data can give extra insight into behavior.

I wrote this program to record the frequency of interruptions per time when I am at the computer.

I chose to create an shortcut to the "+" key.

The text file needs to be in the same directory as the program or the project.

The file written to is named "mhaic". Changing the name of the file is needed.

Second fputs function adds something in the same line of time and date.


Future plans:

I intend to use the difference of time function called difftime to plot the data.

I will plot the data with a histogram graphic too. The x and y axis are frequency of interruptions per hour.

It will be used to distinguish the better time of the day to work in the computer and maybe to manipulate the distribution of attention dispensed in the day.
